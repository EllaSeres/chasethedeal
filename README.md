## Pitch

In "Chase the Deal," players can experience the thrill of both sides of the
chase by playing as either the daring dealer on the run or the relentless cop
hot on their trail. As the dealer, your mission is to collect as much weed as
possible while navigating through the city, all while trying to avoid getting
caught by the cop. Use your agility and street smarts to outrun the cop, collect
power-ups, and become the top dealer in the city. As the cop, your mission is to
stop the dealer in their tracks and put an end to their weed dealing operation.
Use your skills and resources to track down the dealer, place obstacles in their
path. With both sides of the chase available to play, "Chase the Deal" offers a
unique and exciting experience that allows players to explore both the thrills
of the chase and the challenges of law enforcement. Will you choose to be the
daring dealer on the run, or the relentless cop hot on their trail? The choice
is yours.
